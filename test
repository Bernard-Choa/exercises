   Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord 
  He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored 
  He hath loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword 
                      His truth is marching on  

   I have seen Him in the watch fires of a hundred circling camps 
  They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps 
  I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps 
                      His day is marching on  

   I have read a fiery gospel  writ in burnished rows of steel 
   As ye deal with my contemners  so with you my grace shall deal 
  Let the Hero  born of woman  crush the serpent with his heel 
                      Since God is marching on   

   He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat 
  He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat 
  Oh  be swift  my soul  to answer Him  be jubilant  my feet 
                      Our God is marching on  

   In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea 
  With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me 
  As he died to make men holy  let us die to make men free 
                      While God is marching on

THE ANTI SLAVERY PRELUDE TO THE GREAT TRAGEDY OF THE CIVIL WAR

The encroachments of the slave power on Northern soil  Green Peace 
  the home of Julia Ward Howe  a center of anti slavery activity  She
  assists her husband  Dr  Samuel Gridley Howe  in editing the
   Commonwealth   He is made chairman of the Vigilance Committee  Slave
  concealed at Green Peace  Charles Sumner is struck down in the United
  States Senate 


The  Battle Hymn of the Republic    the crimson flower of battle  
bloomed in a single night  It sprang from the very soil of the
conflict  in the midst of the Civil War  Yet the plant which produced
it was of slow growth  with roots reaching far back into the past 

In order to understand how this song of our nation sprang into sudden
being we must study that stormy past  the prelude of the Civil War 
How greatly it affected my mother we shall see from her own record  as
well as from the story of the events that touched her so nearly  My
own memory of them dates back to childhood s days  Yet they moved and
stirred my soul as few things have done in a long life 

Therefore I have striven to give to the present generation some idea
of the fervor and ferment  the exaltation of spirit  that prevailed at
that epoch among the soldiers of a great cause  especially as I saw it
in our household 

                                        

  Let the Hero  born of woman  crush the serpent with his heel 

So many years have elapsed since the evil monster of slavery was done
to death that we sometimes forget its awful power in the middle of the
last century  The fathers of the Republic believed that it would soon
perish  They forbade its entrance into the Territories and were careful
to make no mention of it in the Constitution 

The invention of the cotton gin changed the whole situation  It was
found that slave labor could be used with profit in the cultivation
of the cotton crop  But slave labor with its wasteful methods
exhausted the soil  Slavery could only be made profitable by constantly
increasing its area  Hence  the Southern leaders departed from the
policy of the fathers of the Republic  Instead of allowing slavery
to die out  they determined to make it perpetual  Instead of keeping
it within the limits prescribed by the ancient law of the land  they
resolved to extend it 

The Missouri Compromise of      gave the first extension of slavery 
opening the great Territory of Missouri to the embrace of the serpent 
The fugitive slave law was signed in       Before this time the return
of runaway negroes had been an uncertain obligation  The new law took
away from State magistrates the decision in cases of this sort and gave
it to United States Commissioners  It imposed penalties on rescues and
denied a jury trial to black men arrested as fugitives  thus greatly
endangering the liberties of free negroes  The Dred Scott decision
 see page      denying that negroes could be citizens  was made in
      In      the Missouri Compromise was repealed by the Kansas and
Nebraska law     Additional territory was thrown open to the sinister
institution which now threatened to become like the great Midgard
snake  holding our country in its suffocating embrace  as that creature
of fable surrounded the earth  It was necessary to fling off the deadly
coils of slavery if we were to endure as a free nation 

The first step was to arouse the sleeping conscience of the people  For
the South was not alone in wishing there should be no interference with
their  peculiar institution   The North was long supine and dreaded any
new movement that might interfere with trade and national prosperity 
I can well remember my father s pointing this out to his children  and
inveighing against the selfishness of the merchants as a class  Alas 
it was a Northern man  Stephen A  Douglas  who was the father of the
Kansas and Nebraska bill 

 The trumpet note of Garrison  had sounded  some years before this
time  the first note of anti slavery protest  But the Garrisonian
abolitionists did not seek to carry the question into politics  Indeed 
they held it to be wrong to vote under the Federal Constitution 
 A league with death and a covenant with hell   as they called it 
Whittier  the Quaker poet  took a more practical view than his
fellow abolitionists and advocated the use of the ballot box 

When the encroachments of the slave power began to threaten seriously
free institutions throughout the country  thinking men at the North saw
that the time for political action had come  There were several early
organizations which preceded the formation of the Republican party  the
Liberty party  Conscience Whigs  Free soilers  as they were called 
My father belonged to the two latter  and I can well remember that my
elder sister and I were nicknamed at school   Little Free Dirters  

The election of Charles Sumner to the United States Senate was an
important victory for the anti slavery men  Dr  Howe  as his most
intimate friend  worked hard to secure it  Yet we see by my father s
letters that he groaned in spirit at the necessity of the political
dickering which he hated 

Women in those days neither spoke in public nor took part in political
affairs  But it may be guessed that my mother was deeply interested
in all that was going on in the world of affairs  and under her own
roof  too  for our house at South Boston became one of the centers of
activity of the anti slavery agitation 

My father  who was some seventeen years older than his wife  well
understood the power of the press  He had employed it to good effect
in his work for the blind  the insane  and others  Hence he became
actively interested in the management of the  Commonwealth   an
anti slavery newspaper  and with my mother s help edited it for an
entire winter  They began work together every morning  he preparing the
political articles  and she the literary ones  Burning words were sent
forth from the quiet precincts of  Green Peace   My mother had thus
named the homestead  lying in its lovely garden  when she came there
early in her married life  Little did she then dream that the repeal of
the Missouri Compromise would disturb its serene repose some ten years
later 

The agitation had not yet become so strong as greatly to affect the
children of the household  We played about the garden as usual and
knew little of the  Commonwealth  undertaking  save as it brought some
delightful juveniles to the editorial sanctum  The little Howes highly
approved of this by product of journalism 

Our mother s pen had been used before this time to help the cause of
the slave  As early as      she contributed a poem to  The Liberty
Bell   an annual edited by Mrs  Maria Norton Chapman and sold at the
anti slavery bazars   In my first published volume   Passion Flowers  
appeared some lines  On the Death of the Slave Lewis   which were wrung
from my indignant heart by a story  alas  too common in those days  of
murderous outrage committed by a master against his human chattel 
  Recollections of the Anti Slavery Struggle   Julia Ward Howe  

Another method of arousing the conscience of the nation was through
the public platform  My father and his friends were anxious to present
the great question in a perfectly fair way  So a series of lectures
was given in Tremont Temple  where the speakers were alternately the
most prominent advocates of slavery at the South and its most strenuous
opponents at the North  Senator Toombs  of Georgia  and General
Houston  of Texas  were among the former 

It was  probably  at this lecture course that my father exercised his
office as chairman in an unusual way  In those days it was the custom
to open the meeting with prayer  and some of the contemporary clergymen
were very long winded  Dr  Howe informed each reverend gentleman
beforehand that at the end of five minutes he should pull the latter s
coat tail  The divines were in such dread of this gentle admonition
that they invariably wound up the prayer within the allotted time 

At this time no criticism of the  peculiar institution  was allowed
at the South  Northerners traveling there were often asked for their
opinion of it  but any unfavorable comment evoked displeasure  Indeed 
a friend of ours  a Northern woman teaching in Louisiana  was called
to book because in his presence she spoke of one of the slaves as a
 man   A negro  she was informed  was not a man  and must never be so
called   Boy  was the proper term to use  This was a logical inference
from Judge Taney s famous Dred Scott decision   viz    that  such
persons    i  e    negroes   were not included among the people  in
the words of the Declaration of Independence  and could not in any
respect be considered as citizens  Yet  to quote Abraham Lincoln
again   Judge Curtis  in his dissenting opinion  shows that in five
of the then thirteen States  to wit  New Hampshire  Massachusetts 
New York  New Jersey  and North Carolina  free negroes were voters 
and in proportion to their numbers had the same part in making the
Constitution that the white people had  

Events now began to move with ever increasing rapidity  The scenes of
the stirring prelude to the Civil War grew ever more stormy  Men became
more and more wrought up as the relentless purpose of the Southern
leaders was gradually revealed  The deadly serpent of slavery became a
hydra headed monster  striking north  east  and west  The hunting of
fugitive slaves took on a sinister activity in the Northern  border 
States  at the national capital the attempts to muzzle free speech
culminated in the striking down of Charles Sumner in the Senate Chamber
itself  in Kansas the  border ruffians  strove to inaugurate a reign
of terror  and succeeded in bringing on a local conflict which was the
true opening of the Civil War 

The men who combated the dragon of slavery  the Siegfrieds of that
day  fought him in all these directions  In Boston Dr  Howe was among
the first to organize resistance to the rendition of fugitive slaves 
An escaped negro was kidnapped there in       This was four years
before the passage by Congress of the fugitive slave law made it the
duty     of the Free States to return runaway negroes to slavery  My
father called a meeting of protest at Faneuil Hall  He was the chief
speaker and  every sentence was a sword thrust   Higginson
account   I give a brief extract from his address 

 The peculiar institution which has so long been brooding over the
country like an incubus has at length spread abroad its murky wings and
has covered us with its benumbing shadow  It has silenced the pulpit 
it has muffled the press  its influence is everywhere     Court Street
can find no way of escape for the poor slave  State Street  that drank
the blood of the martyrs of liberty  State Street is deaf to the cry
of the oppressed slave  the port of Boston that has been shut up by a
tyrant king as the dangerous haunt of free men  the port of Boston has
been opened to the slave trader  for God s sake  Mr  Chairman  let us
keep Faneuil Hall free  

Charles Sumner  Wendell Phillips  and Theodore Parker also spoke  John
Quincy Adams presided at the meeting 

The meeting resulted in the formation of a vigilance committee of
forty  with my father as chairman  This continued its work until
the hunting of fugitives ceased in Boston  Secrecy necessarily
characterized its proceedings  An undated note from Dr  Howe to
Theodore Parker gives us a hint of them 

     DEAR    Write me a note by bearer  Tell him merely whether I am
  wanted to night  if I am he will act accordingly about bringing my
  wagon 

  I could bring any one here and keep him secret a week and no person
  except Mrs  and myself would know it
                                               Yours 
                                                                CHEV    

This letter raises an interesting question  Were fugitives concealed 
unknown to us children  in our house  It is quite possible  for both
our parents could keep a secret  I remember a young white girl who was
so hidden from her drunken father until other arrangements could be
made for her  I remember also a negro girl  hardly more than a child 
who was secreted beneath the roof of Green Peace  Her mistress had
brought her to Boston as a servant  Since she was not a runaway  the
provisions of the odious fugitive slave law did not apply to her  Here
at least we could cry 

  No fetters in the Bay State 
  No slave upon her land 

My father applied to the courts and in due process of time Martha was
declared free  so long as she remained on Northern soil  It may be
guessed that she did not care to return to the South 

The feeling of the community was strongly opposed to taking part in
slave hunts  Yankee ingenuity often found a way to escape this odious
task  and yet keep within the letter of the law 

A certain United States marshal thus explained his proceedings 

 Why  I never have any trouble about runaway slaves  If I hear that one
has come to Boston I just go up to Nigger Hill  a part of Joy Street 
and say to them   Do you know of any runaway slaves about here   And
they never do  

This was a somewhat unique way of giving notice to the friends of the
fugitive that the officers of the law were after him 

If he could only escape over the border into free Canada he was safe 
According to the English law no slave could remain such on British
soil  The moment he  shook the Lion s paw  he became free  Our law in
these United States is founded on the English Common Law  Alas  the
pro slavery party succeeded in overthrowing it  No wonder that Senator
Toombs  of Georgia  boasted that he would call the roll of his slaves
under the shadow of Bunker Hill Monument  The fugitive slave law gave
him the power to do this  and thus make our boasted freedom of the soil
only an empty mockery
